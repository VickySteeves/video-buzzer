Video Buzzer
============

This is a couch gaming system for television shows. It is a video player (that you should display on your TV) that allows players to buzz from their smartphone, which pauses the video.

The workflow is as follow:

* Navigate to the application on your smart TV (or a computer hooked to the TV)
* Load a local video file
* Each player enters the displayed link into their smartphone, then their name when prompted. They now see a buzzer button
* Play the video file. During the show, players can buzz, which displays their name on the TV and pauses the video so they can give their answer
* The video file resumes and the player finds out if they were right

Note that:

* If the answer given is incorrect, there is no possibility for an other player to give another (because the recorded show will state the correct answer)
* This requires players to be in the same room, the video is not streamed to each device, just played on the "host" device (TV)
* This works with any recorded game show, so long as it is not too interactive (because the recording won't respond to your actions)
